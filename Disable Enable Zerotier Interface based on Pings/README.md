## Network Monitoring and ZeroTier Interface Management Script

Introduction:
This document provides a script for MikroTik RouterOS 7 that monitors network connectivity by pinging an IP address. If the ping fails, the script temporarily disables and re-enables the ZeroTier interface to facilitate network recovery. 

Script Functionality:
The script continuously pings the specified IP address to assess network connectivity. If a ping failure occurs, the script disables the ZeroTier interface for a brief period before re-enabling it. This script will try the ping loop for the specified IP address for 10 times and then kill the loop.

By adding the script to the System Scripts, you can easily manage and schedule its execution. For example, you can use the Scheduler feature in RouterOS to run the script at specific intervals or times of the day.

Instructions:
1. Access the MikroTik RouterOS 7 administration interface.
2. Navigate to "System Scripts" and create a new script.
3. Copy the provided script code into the script editor, ensuring to modify the target IP address and ZeroTier interface as required.
4. Save the script and return to the Terminal window.
5. Run the script using the command: `/system script run <script-name>`.
6. Monitor the script's execution as it continuously pings the IP address and manages the ZeroTier interface based on connectivity status.

Please test the script in a controlled environment before implementing it in a production network.
